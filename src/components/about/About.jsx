              ey! Iâ€™m Rahmawan, a software engineer based in Pekalongan City, designing the future one line of code at a
              time. I started my career in a different fieldâ€”brewingâ€”which gave me a unique perspective, honing skills
              like problem-solving, attention to detail, and project management that now enhance my engineering work.

              Living in a smaller city like Pekalongan has its own charm, offering a slower pace of life and lower cost
              of living while still presenting opportunities to work with local startups or remote companies in the tech
              industry.
